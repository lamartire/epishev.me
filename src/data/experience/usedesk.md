Joined the team for solving problems with frontend part redesign. The main
responsibilities were in application architecture redesign and supporting
exist features.

The next key moment – re-implementation of current widget (which was developed
during work in [Indotech](https://indotech.ru)) with new technologies stack for
better scalability and reliability. New widget was in 4 times smallier with 
saving features of exist solution. Also, it had "co-browsing" feature – it allows
to operator look at current user browser state and interact with last one for
better client experience (the best analogy – is teamviewer or google remote
desktop). This moment significantly reduced problems and bug relates to widget.
