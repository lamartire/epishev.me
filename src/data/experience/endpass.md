Participated at ecosystem development for working with personal data and effective 
working with Ethereum platform.

The first project which I have joined was [Endpass Wallet](https://wallet.endpass.com). In
that project context my main responsibilities were â€“ features development, architectural
questions solving, code review.

The next projects is a chain of two products â€“ [Endpass Auth application](https://github.com/endpass/endpass-auth)
and [Endpass Connect library](https://github.com/endpass/endpass-connect). This stack allows to
users integrate OAuth2 feature to their sites and web-applications. Also it provides feature
to send Ethereum transactions and sign any data with user's wallet.

Also I have done the first version on Endpass Widget â€“ lightweight and very modular
solution which provides by Endpass Connect library. It just renders on the site and
gives to users ability to current wallet balance management, switching between accounts
and creating of new accounts.

The main features of Endpass Auth, Connect and Widget can be checked [here](https://endpass.github.io/connect-demo).
